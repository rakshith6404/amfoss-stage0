# Let me C

### This was also the easiest tasks in my opinion.I did the whole task in CS50-ide which helped me a lot in many ways,and then finally i removed all the bugs in it.
### CS50 videos literally helped me a lot in this task as from week-1 onwards they teach you C.So these videos helped me a lot to do work on this task,and also i referred to some articles and sites which could help me in some of the function methods used which i didnt know,*and ofc thanks to GOOGLE who helped me get this done .*

### Here are some of the sites and videos that i referred to get this task moving.
