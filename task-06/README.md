# Flutter based UI task

### Flutter based task was the most interesting and also a hectic one tbh cause i literally spent days on researches(tbh 3days) and also came across tons and tons of articles and also some of the Flutter Tutorials that i actually referred to.<br />

### After seeing people creating awesome applications in android i  was imagining how do these people make them...and thats when amFoss gave me a chance to create my own app.I literally took days to complete this task and also didnt lose hope cause last time i did this one , it was a big failure . But this time i didnt wanted to fail the same thing again so i literally didnt lose hope on this and started to do it with at most concentration.

## **My flutter App:**
