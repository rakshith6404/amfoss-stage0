#### Here i have used multiple comands that could *make a directory/folder , copy a folder from one direcetory to another, rename a folder ,etc and also in this file ill show the commands that i use for pushing the files to my [GitHub]() repositories

- "*mkdir name_directory*" used for making a directory.
- "*touch filename.txt*" is the command i used for it.
- "*sudo nano<file_name.txt> to edit files using terminal.
- "*cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt*" used for copying texts from one file to another(or multiple to one).
- "*cp <file_name.txt><to:file_directory or path of the file>* is the command i used to copy files. 
- "*mv <file_name.txt><to:file_directory or the name to be renamed to>*" used to move or rename file.
- "*rm<file_name>*" used to remove a file.


## **Pushing the folder to Github**
- git init
- git add <file_name> or git add . (to add the files in that path, i gave git add .)
- git commit -m "first commit" 
- git remote add origin <ssh link or HTTP link of yout repo> (i have used SSH)
- git push -u origin main
## **AND HERE IT IS MY FILE IS PUSHED USING THE THE TERMINAL**
