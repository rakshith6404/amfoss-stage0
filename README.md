Will work hard under any circumstances and also want to learn a lot about technology and their working , wanna makesomething really great in this world cause and this is the only platform/club to learn everything needed .Have to develop my skill in most part of the computer knowledge.The tasks were the first and the foremost step to this !!!!!!
